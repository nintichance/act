##OKR (Object Key Result)

* An OKR is to state what you are trying to achieve and how you will know you've accomplished that.
* The Key Result is the measurement, while the objective is the "thesis statement".

##Product Market Fit

* What can the consumer actually use?
* Is the "MVP" a use-able, valuable product to the consumer?
