#Track Velocity
* Forecasting how many things that we can get done in a sprint
* Prioritization of stories & epics (Based on velocity, we can determine what features we can do first or if we cut out these stories, we can get it done faster"
* Determine the time it will take to deliver a feature based on average points per sprint
