The goal of this mentorship with Daniel is to sharpen Ninti's ability to refactor old, inefficient code in Ruby on Rails and React by honing her problem solving skills and building a better foundation of universal computer science concepts such as data structures and algorithms, object oriented programming, and design patterns that make for better code.

While developing knowledge of these concepts and skills, they will be practically applied through building a React on Rails app from inception to deployment to Cloud Foundry using the Concourse Ci pipeline resource.

The app subject is TBD, but is leaning towards being a mobile-first app where actors and casting directors can come to find projects and talent. CSS Grid will be used. The database will be MariaDB.
